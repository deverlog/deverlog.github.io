Who Am I
WAI = WHY
When I'm listening to Jordan Peterson carefully, I feel greatness of him. Today I saw him speaking that although most people spend so many times in studying and developing ourselves but
maybe they would have never had times in whether we worth living.
And he added When someone set a goal, and if he's completely motivated with his goal, then he can achieve it successfully within 3 years.
It would be harsh but what that means is great.
And maybe I should set a goal first and I should raise abilities to overcome temptations. Because to endure temptation is definitely an ability.(Actually I spent lots of time in SNS and Youtube)

1. I should set a goal, which is not a material goal but a motivating goal
2. To become a successful man I'll have an ability to endure(overcome) temptation right after and see future
